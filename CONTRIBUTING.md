# How to Contribute

To clarify how you can contribute, let's first discuss the dual purpose of this educational project:

## Educational Purpose

This command line tool helps students of the Game Development curriculum within [Digital Arts and Entertainment](https://duckduckgo.com) work with vectors, dot and cross products, and complex numbers. The tool simplifies calculations compared to handheld calculators and includes support for trigonometric functions, powers, and standard mathematical operators.

## Best Practices Example

We aim to implement best practices for a software project, including version control, version numbering, unit tests, and a comprehensive cross-platform build system. The project currently has C++ and Java versions.

The project also utilizes ANTLR to define the grammar of the command line tool. Defining a simple programming language is a valuable experience for any software engineer, and we hope to inspire students to try it at least once.

## How to Contribute for the Educational Part

We strive to keep the tool simple, but suggestions for improvement are always welcome. We're open to collaboration if you want to use the tool in another setting, such as testing mathematical functionality in a game engine.

Bug reports are always appreciated. Please include the version in which you found the bug.

## How to Contribute for the Best Practices Part

We use several technologies in the project and do our best to implement best practices. However, there's always room for improvement. Feedback on the C++ and Java implementations is welcome.

For the build system, we use CMake. We should consider moving to the package system of CMake and adding build scripts on GitHub for a full release build with uploads to the correct release tag.

The Java part of the repository is meant to be included in a mathematical tool (FXMath) I created. Implementing the same functionality in two languages is an interesting exercise for me as an educator. Feedback on this implementation is more than welcome.
